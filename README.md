# Apple-1-6800
Apple 1 6800 Clone of the Apple I

# Notes

I collect vintage computers and have done so before they were vintage. I went to school for electronics at the beginning of the home computer age and later switch to networking and software. I'm still employed in the industry and enjoy the challenge.

So, I went and purchased a couple of Apple I clone boards because I of my love of old computers and building electronics. I've done this with other hard to find vintage computers (the SWTPC). Building these computers is fun and brings me back to the early days of computing when I started with electroncs and software. Don't get me wrong, I like newer electronics also. I didn't build my Home Automation with any of these these vintage chip sets. Since I can't afford an actual Apple I (or many of the other vintage computers) I grew up with, a clone is a pretty good fit ... well usually. This time I bit off more than I can chew. An entire Apple I clone with all the really hard to find parts can run more than $1000 (US) and I want to build two (one 6502, one 6800). Yup, should have done a bit more research. Now I've come up with some work-arounds for the expensive video and keyboard sections but I'd still like to build with the actual parts. So I'll have a working Apple I (I hope) and work on getting the unobtainium parts over time. 

Just a note, I'm not even close to being the first to build these boards. Lots of folks have gone this route. Those folks have left great notes and I've found all sorts of interesting information on how to work around all sorts of problems. I'll add the links below so others can take advantage of the information. Also a good search with Apple 1 rather than apple I works better.

# Why a 6800 Apple 1?

I like Motorola CPU and their instruction set. One of my first jobs, out of college, was working with Motorola embedded board (6800, 6802, 6809 and 68000). So while my first computer is my Atari 800XL I mostly worked with Motorola.
